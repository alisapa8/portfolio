### Calculator (2025)

This Processing sketch, implements a visually styled calculator interface that supports a range of arithmetic and scientific operations. The calculator is made up of 22 interactive buttonsâ€”10 for numeric input and 12 for functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, square root, square, percentage, and sign inversion. The program is designed with a clean and colorful UI, where each button responds visually when hovered over and clicked. The calculator handles input dynamically through mouse interactions, distinguishing between left and right operands using a boolean flag and string-based state management (`dVal`) to track input. Upon pressing the equals button, the appropriate operation is executed via the `performCalculation()` function, updating the display in real time. A clear button resets all states. With responsive font sizing for long numbers and real-time output display, the calculator provides an intuitive and interactive experience for basic and advanced calculations alike.
